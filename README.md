HackMate - a SaaS web app that combines:

Networking for participants (students, developers).

Hackathon/event management for organizers.

Recruitment for recruiters.

Analytics + funding for sponsors.

Think of it as a mix of LinkedIn + Devpost + Hackathon tooling, but simplified and student-friendly.

👥 User Types
1. Participants (students / hackers)

Create & maintain profiles:

Name, age, city, skills, tech stack.

GitHub integration → automatically fetch last 10 projects.

List hackathons they’ve joined.

Networking:

Mutual-only connections (like LinkedIn “connections,” not followers).

Connection suggestions based on complementary roles/tech stacks (e.g., frontend → backend).

No spammy paragraphs; profiles are suggested by stack & role.

Events:

Join public events directly.

Join private events via 6-digit code.

See feed of upcoming hackathons.

Teamify:

Once per event, participants can propose a team:

Set max size.

Roles needed.

Project idea.

Teams formed from connections + complementary skills.

2. Organizers

Create and manage events:

Title, description, type (public/private).

Dashboard to manage their events.

Post announcements → broadcast instantly to participants.

Use Teamify algorithm:

Auto-form balanced teams from all participants.

Newbies (<3 hackathons) grouped separately to avoid disrupting experienced hackers.

Manage everything in-app (no WhatsApp/Telegram juggling).

3. Sponsors

Separate signup.

Engagement, number of participants, best projects.

Basically, matchmakers between sponsors and organizers.

4. Recruiters

Separate signup.
